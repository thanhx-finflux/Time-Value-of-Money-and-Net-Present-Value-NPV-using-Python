# Time-Value-of-Money-and-Net-Present-Value-NPV-using-Python
This project includes code for calculating Future Value (FV) and NPV, and visualizations with Matplotlib.

### Key Concepts
- Present value (PV): Current worth of future cash flows.
- Future value (FV): Future worth of current investments.
- Discount Rate: Rate accounting for opportunity cost, risk, and inflation.

  Discount rates can vary based on factors such as inflation, risk, and opportunity cost. A higher discount rate typically reduces the present value of future cash flows, making investments less attractive. Conversely, a lower discount rate increases the present value, making investments more appealing.

-Scenario Analysis: Comparison of NPV for different cash flow scenarios

-    'Scenario 1': [-1000, 300, 400, 500, 600],
-    'Scenario 2': [-1000, 200, 300, 400, 500],
-    'Scenario 3': [-1000, 400, 500, 600, 700]

{'Scenario 1': 574.0663612383728,
 'Scenario 2': 219.47131082213673,
 'Scenario 3': 928.6614116546087}

 - Scenario Analysis: The assumption is that the initial investment requires $2000, and the project will have an annual cash inflow of $1000 over 3 years. To compare $2000 with $3000 in total, the analyst needs to consider the time value of money, which is discounted at a rate of 5% per annum.

- Net Present Value (NPV) for $2000 investment: $723.25
- Net Present Value (NPV) for $3000 investment: $-276.75
